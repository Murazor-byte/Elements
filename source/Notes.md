**Atoms**: are neutral; they contain the same number of protons as electrons
**Ion**: is an electrically charged particle produced by either removing electrons from a neutral atom to give a positive ion or adding electrons to a neutral atom to give a negative ion


**Reactants**: a substance that takes part in and undergoes change during a reaction
**Products**: species formed from chemical reactions



**Molecular Fomula**: representation of a molecule that uses chemical symbols to indicate the types of atoms followed by subscripts to show the number of atoms of each type in the molecule.

**Structural Formula**: shows how the atoms are connected in the molecule.

**Emperical Formula**: indicates the types of atoms present and the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound

**Molecular formula**, C8H16O4; empirical formula, C2H4O



**Balancing Chemical Equations**: Balances the number of molecules for each compound for both the products and reactants. This is helpful for knowing the quantity of reactant moelcules for creating a product



**Chemical Reaction**:
**Synthesis**: Copmpound made from similar materials (A + B => AB)

**Decomposition**: A compound is broken into simplier compounds, or all the way down to the elements that make it up (AB => A + B)

**Combusiton**: A compound containing Carbon and Hydrogen (sometimes Oxygen) and combines with oxygen gas to produce carbon dioxide and water (C~x~H~y~(O~2~) + O~2~ => CO~2~ + H~2~O)

**Single Displacement**: One element that starts out by itself replace another element in a compound, 'kicking' it out (A + BC = > B + AC)

**Doubel Displacement**: The positive and negative ions in two compounds switch (AB + CD => AD + BC)

- Look at charges of each element pair. The quantity of each element in the product compound is equivalent to the charge (either positive or negative) of it's bonding elemnt
- There are some exceptions for example in combustion where water, hydrogen or carbon are created
- Exception for transition metals as their ionic charges (#electrons) can chanage
